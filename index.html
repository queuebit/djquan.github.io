		<p>I&rsquo;ve started to dive into some more design resources.</p>

<p>Code School&rsquo;s Journey into Mobile is a pretty good introduction to responsive design. Responsive design is designing your site so that it looks good in varying resolutions and devices.  It is extremely important with the variety of ways people can visit a site. It involves using percentages or ems (relative units in css).  Also, it involves finding &ldquo;break points&rdquo;, resolutions which the site design changes. All in all, it was eye opening at the amount of thought and work that it takes to make a site responsive; especially since tools like Twitter&rsquo;s Bootstrap can hide all the magic of responsive design.</p>

<p>Sass is stylesheet language that compiles into CSS.  It lets you do more with less lines of code.  It&rsquo;s similar to CoffeeScript, in the sense that it 1.) simplifies the syntax and 2.) makes it feel more like a programming language.  For example, the text below is in Sass.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sass'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$authors</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">bob</span> <span class="n">tim</span> <span class="n">sue</span> <span class="n">kate</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.author</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="na">float</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="no">left</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="na">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="kt">%</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="nf">length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$authors</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">// automatically updates if $authors changes</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>$authors is a list, which functions much like an array.  You can iterate through it using each, find the index of a value, and many more commands you&rsquo;d expect from an array.  The example above automatically updates the width of a css selector (.author) to adjust to adding new authors.</p>

		<p>Back to learning!</p>

<p>I recommend checking out the Ruby Rogues episode on imposter syndrom.  As someone new to programming, it&rsquo;s nice to hear that even the experts can feel like they don&rsquo;t belong or people will realize that they don&rsquo;t know as much as they should.</p>

<p>I attended Spree Conf in DC; and I definitely felt that I didn&rsquo;t belong, and that created a lot of fear and anxiety. I&rsquo;ve been studying for over four months, and I&rsquo;m fairly accomplished in other areas, but it was still terrifying to be that new person in the room.  This RubyRogues episode definitely has helped my outlook, and I&rsquo;m excited to go to my next conference (RubyNation!).</p>

<p>I recently attended a webinar on vim by Drew Neil, the man who wrote <em>Practical Vim</em>.  I definitely recommend attending; it is easily worth the relatively steep price.  I&rsquo;d read (or skim) the book and check out some of his vimcasts beforehand to get the most out of it.  The major focus points were: Macros and text objects, but I also feel more comfortable just dealing with registers, buffers, and args.</p>

<p>vim helpful tip for your .vimrc.  This lets you use the dot command in visual mode. Great for applying the last change on many lines.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="c">&quot; adds dot command to visual mode &quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">vnoremap</span> . :norm.<span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Say you wanted to add a semicolon to multiple lines.</p>

<p>A;       ~  Appends a semicolon to the current line</p>

<p>vG       ~  Selects to the last line of the file, could easily be a different selector.</p>

<p>.         ~  Appends a semicolon to every line selected.</p>

<p>No idea why this doesn&rsquo;t work out of the box for vim.</p>

		<p>This will probably be my last update for about a week.  I&rsquo;m driving cross country on monday, so I won&rsquo;t have too much time to update the blog.  I do plan on learning more through various audio podcasts during the drive.  Some of them include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Changelog</li>
<li>RubyRogues</li>
<li>Giant Robots Smashing into Other Giant Robots</li>
<li>Ruby Freelancers</li>
<li>Javascript Jabber</li>
</ul>


<p>Feel free to post suggestions in the comments section. Learning to program is inherently visual and tactile, but there must be some other good audio only resources out there.  It is too bad there aren&rsquo;t many audio versions of technical books.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written a bit on Thoughtbot&rsquo;s Learn Prime.  This week, they had a pretty awesome &ldquo;Ask Me Anything&rdquo; session with Ben Orenstein. More features like this would definitely make Learn Prime appealing after I have finished all of their workshops.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve signed up for an online <a href="http://vimcasts.org/classes/core-vim">vim seminar</a> on June 3rd that should raise my vim skills to the next level. I&rsquo;ll be sure to post my thoughts on that.</p>

<p>Web development is much more than knowing how to write a Ruby on Rails app.  Learning javascript well is becoming a major priority for me.  Javascript isn&rsquo;t the prettiest language, but a lot of the exciting frameworks (backbone, ember, node, angular) rely on it.</p>

<p>Node.js is a server-side system of responding to events quickly and reliably. I definitely recommend the Code School course on it.  It was one of the more challenging courses, and I learned more because of that.</p>

		<p>The RubyNation <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/schedule">Speaker List</a> looks amazing. Sandi Metz, Avdi Grimm, Russ Olsen, Steve Klabnik&hellip;I&rsquo;m definitely excited about it.</p>

<p>CoffeScript is a language that compiles into javascript.  The Code School course on CoffeeScript was a nice introduction to it, and it was also a good refresher on basic javascript.  The course has a lot of examples of translating from javascript and jquery into pure coffeescript, which I found really helpful.</p>

<p>There is a lot <a href="http://wekeroad.com/2012/03/21/coffeescript-or-straight-up-js-i-suck-either-way/">written</a> about the pros and cons of CoffeeScript weighed against pure JavaScript. I do like that CoffeeScript appears to be more similar in syntax to Ruby. I don&rsquo;t look it as a JavaScript vs CoffeeScript choice.  To write well in CoffeeScript, you need to have a firm understanding of basic JavaScript to debug errors and really understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve done a fair amount of coding(and blogging) using vim exclusively, and I&rsquo;ve been thrilled with how it&rsquo;s going.  I&rsquo;ve improved my efficiency by not having to switch windows to perform tests, rake tasks, or any other command line work.  Moreover, being able to work quickly without using the mouse at all is liberating.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still reading through <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">Practical Vim</a>, and it&rsquo;s been a great resource so far. I still need to learn more about registers (vim&rsquo;s tools to copy and paste).  I also still need to find a snippet(ways of expanding text) solution that works well for me.  Still, I can&rsquo;t see myself moving away from vim+tmux anytime soon.</p>

		<p>The Ruby Rogues episode on <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/105-rr-regular-expressions-with-nell-shamrell/">regular expressions</a> is pretty awesome. Regular expressions are a way to express patterns in a programming language.  Regular expressions are powerful, but can be very intimidating. <a href="http://rubular.com">Rubular</a> is a nice tool to play around with them, and the chapter on regular expressions in <em>The Well Grounded Rubyist</em> provides a great explanation.</p>

<p>I passed the CA bar exam! That being said, landing a job as a web developer is still my number one goal.  Being a lawyer will be just another skill that I bring to the table.  This means that I&rsquo;ll need to find resources to learn about laws and regulations that affect start-ups. Being a web developer that can also handle routine and simple legal issues will help me stand out.  Web Developer / Counsel would be a nice job title.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lawline.com/">Lawline</a> might be a good resource to learn more. I tried a course on them about negotating SaaS deals which was pretty informative. A general theme of the video was to be explicit about every provision, including confidentiality and ownership. The instructor also stated that the majority of contracts created by tech vendors are pretty horrible because companies tend to reuse old contract and they aren&rsquo;t clear on the intent of the agreement.</p>

<p>Heads up, Code School will be <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/free-weekend?fb_action_ids=10201128707883052&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_ref=.UZaSvvvXBpk.send&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582">free</a> May 25th to May 26th.

		<p>One of the great things about the ruby (and software community in general) is that there are a lot of resources available to learn from.</p>

<p><a href="http://destroyallsoftware.com">Destroy All Software</a> has just made the screencasts available for purchase by season. They weren&rsquo;t available for the past few months while Gary Bernhardt switched pricing models.  I&rsquo;m working through the first season right now and am learning a lot.  It&rsquo;s almost worth it alone to see how fast and efficient he is with vim.</p>

<p>Vim tip: Relative numbers is a <a href="http://forum.thoughtbot.com/t/give-set-relativenumber-a-try/22">winner</a>.</p>

<p>Give octopress a try. It&rsquo;s easy to set up.  It&rsquo;s easy to post content.</p>

<ul>
<li>Octopress makes it incredibly easy to write and publish from the command line.</li>
<li>Everything about an octopress blog will be stored locally.</li>
<li>This gives freedom to switch publishing platforms or web hosts and a local backup of posts(with version control!).</li>
<li>Octopress is made for coders.  Inserting code snippets is incredibly easy.  There are also a large number of plugins to extend functionality.</li>
</ul>


<p>I will miss some aspects of tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tumblr is an incredible way to make connections and really is social blogging at its best.</li>
<li>Tumblr has apps to make mobile publishing simple.</li>

<p>Octopress is a framework built on Jekyll, a static blog generator.</p>

<p>I think as I get more familiar with it, the switch to octopress will allow me a greater ability to customize the site.
Moreover, octopress (and jekyll) allow me a greater freedom in how I write my posts.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><strong>Intro to tmux</strong></p>


<p>tmux is a terminal multiplexer. &nbsp;At it&#8217;s most basic, it allows you create windows and panes inside a tmux session. &nbsp;Each window and pane is a separate instance of a terminal. &nbsp;</p>


<p>I&#8217;ll try to explain why tmux works <em>for me</em>, and I&#8217;ll finish with links on how to set it up. &nbsp;</p>


<p>This is not aimed to be a guide on setting up tmux, or how to use tmux. &nbsp;It is just an explanation of why it has become essential<em> to me</em>, and why it is worth a try. &nbsp;There are alternatives; iterm2 has it&#8217;s own way of handling panes; there is also screen. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t tried either, and I&#8217;m not implying that tmux is better than either. &nbsp;</p>


<p><span>Also, I am still a novice; I have a tremendous amount to learn about improving my workflow.</span></p>


<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6565481/tmux.png"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/7ca4b1bdf4c5fb7d5ab1d5dfe10cad9a/tumblr_inline_mmt29dEyHR1qz4rgp.png" /></a></p>


<p><strong>Panes, Panes, Panes.</strong></p>


<p>Since I began to code through test-driven-development, I almost always code so that I can see both my test file and the code that it is testing. &nbsp;In sublime, this involved using a two column layout. &nbsp;In vim, I accomplished this through split panes. &nbsp;It is important to see the tests and the code at the same time. &nbsp;</p>


<p>tmux lets me keep a command prompt as a pane in the lower 20% of the screen. &nbsp;This is useful in so many ways. &nbsp;I use it most often for running tests. &nbsp;Using the vim add-on <a href="https://github.com/epeli/slimux">slimux</a>, I can easily send commands to any pane or window I want. &nbsp;Telling that pane to run a test generally requires no more than two keystrokes.</p>


<p>An amazing plugin for Sublime that lets you test is RubyTest. &nbsp;<span>However, tmux allows me to do much more than test. &nbsp;It gives me a full terminal to use that I can expand anytime I want. &nbsp;For example, if I edited a User model to include some database migrations, I would need to run rake db:migrate and rake db:test:prepare before running my actual tests. &nbsp;In Sublime, this requires switching to the terminal app and running those commands, and switching back. &nbsp; In vim, I could accomplish this with :! rake&#8230;.but the resulting output would take up the screen until I pressed enter.</span></p>


<p><span>With tmux, I can do both of these from my text editor without losing focus of my text editor. &nbsp;I am able to see the results of the test and keep typing code.</span></p>


<p>The main advantage of tmux is that I don&#8217;t have to leave tmux for routine editing. &nbsp;Of course, my workflow would be different if I was doing front-end work (designing the site, making sure javascript worked, etc).&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>


<p>Windows are pretty much just tabs. &nbsp;To my knowledge, tmux doesn&#8217;t really add anything crazy to it, but they are there.&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Persistence</strong></p>


<p>tmux has sessions, and it stores persistence. &nbsp;Unless I restart my computer(which does end the session), when I open tmux again, my session will still remain there. &nbsp;Tmux doesn&#8217;t <em>save&nbsp;</em>my session. &nbsp;It keeps running it and by opening tmux again, I am just re-connecting to it.&nbsp;</p>


<p>There are at least two major advantages of this. &nbsp;First, I can quit terminal and come back to my work later without any hesitation. &nbsp;Second, when I return, apps that were running will still be running. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t need to restart my rails server. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t need to open up my rails console again. &nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Sessions</strong></p>


<p>You can have as many sessions as you want. &nbsp;For me, this means having different projects as different sessions. &nbsp;This allows me to switch between them (or work on both of them) at once really easily. &nbsp;Persistence, as mentioned above, becomes incredibly more useful when dealing with multiple projects.</p>


<p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>


<p>Copy and paste from the Mac clipboard does require an additional program (reattach-to-user-namespace) and work, but it is manageable and worth it.&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Plugins worth mentioning</strong></p>


<p><a href="https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator">Tmuxinator</a> allows you to set defaults and save those projects. &nbsp; Slimux lets you send commands to specific panes. &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/vim-turbux">Vim-turbux</a> allows you to send testing commands to panes.</p>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>


<p>Sorry if any of it came off as confusing; I definitely recommend going through a few of the resources below to get a better understanding of tmux&#8217;s power.</p>


<p>I do love working in tmux, but like vim, there is a slight learning curve before becoming really effective with it. &nbsp;Like vim, the preset defaults aren&#8217;t terrific.</p>


<p>The above reasons are why tmux works well for me. &nbsp;There are a lot of reasons to switch that I haven&#8217;t covered, like working on an <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/six-weeks-working-android/">android tablet</a> efficiently or using it to <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/how-we-use-tmux-for-remote-pair-programming/">pair program</a>. &nbsp;</p>
