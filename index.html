		<p>Today was spent mostly working on my actual bake sale event class. It definitely took longer than I had expected, and I&rsquo;m only mostly done.</p>

<p>Russ Olsen, at RubyNation, was talking about how programming and web development is a profession where progress is not made linearly. It&rsquo;s based on problem solving and &ldquo;A-ha!&rdquo; moments. To paraphrase:  A lot of the time, it&rsquo;s not you work for X hours and you get Y done.</p>

<p>Some issues I ran into today include dealing with strong parameters for a model that &ldquo;belongs to&rdquo; a devise model and dealing with form helpers for nested attributes. Up till now, form helpers just worked and I didn&rsquo;t really need to understand how they worked (a lot of rails can be like that).  But, when you deviate from normal convention a little, you really begin to understand them better as you work through issues you are having.</p>

<p>Another mention for code-climate.  Having it follow an open source github repo <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/signup">is easy</a>. It&rsquo;ll then create a site that you can refresh at will.  The statistics are nice, and I just noticed that they were pointing to a code smell of mine: the dreaded code duplication.  The link is <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/djquan/bake_sale/smells">here</a>, but hopefully I&rsquo;ll have time to fix it soon. My duplication is that my organization and user model check the same validation on usernames.  Not horrible, but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a way to extract it to a helper.</p>

<p>Check out Rails-ERD(Entity-Relationship Diagrams). It&rsquo;s really easy to <a href="http://rails-erd.rubyforge.org/install.html">install</a>.  Basically, it automatically creates diagrams based on the models you have and their relationships. It&rsquo;s a nice way to see relationships.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6565481/erd.png" alt="Simple right now.." /></p>

<p>So right now it&rsquo;s my app is fairly simple (and look how much stuff devise adds..), but it should start to have some more advanced logic soon.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be a somewhat lighter day; I&rsquo;ll finish up the event class.  So that&rsquo;ll include the date/time logic and forms for inputing that. I might also look into Spring to speed up tests.</p>

<p>I also started the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/startup">Startup Engineering class by Stanford at Coursea</a>.  So far, it&rsquo;s pretty interesting &ndash; it does focus on javascript skills which is a nice benefit.  It&rsquo;s good to learn multiple frameworks and languages.</p>

<p>Also, thanks queuebit for the pull request.  I had a broken link, and queubit graciously sent a pull request to fix it.  A nice use of a PR as my entire blog site, including content, is on github.</p>

<p>Random vim newbie lesson.  :set spell (from the command mode, only when you need it)</p>

<p>I do all my blog writing in vim. When I&rsquo;m somewhat finished writing, I&rsquo;ll enter the above command and see spelling errors underlined. Definitely not the most revolutionary idea, but it&rsquo;s worth a mention.  I don&rsquo;t use it enough to warrant make and memorize a key binding though.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I decided to go with devise over building my own authentication system.  I thought I would elaborate on that choice a little. In other tutorials, I have done my own authentication from scratch.  It is often preferable because most of the authentication gems go way overboard on the features and the routes.</p>

<p>I recognize those arguments, and I chose devise for a few reasons.  First, features are nice. The site will be a reflection of my skills to potential clients and HR representatives&hellip;and I&rsquo;m sure many of them would be more impressed by features than rolling your own authentication system from scratch.  Second, speed.  I&rsquo;m giving myself a week to push something to the web, and devise gives you a lot for a small amount of time.  Third, and probably the biggest factor, was that I am implementing two authentication systems: one for general users (bakers) and one for organizations.  Each one will have different logic associated with it (i.e, organizations will have events).</p>

<p>Today I worked more on my user model, adding a city and profile to it and the views.  I also added my second model, the organizations, along with authentication for that as well.  I worked a bit on the design.  For a deeper understanding, check out my <a href="https://github.com/djquan/bake_sale/commits">commit history</a>.  I&rsquo;m trying to follow good git practices like committing constantly and working on a separate feature branch. Good habits are formed early.</p>

<p>Code Climate is pretty neat, and free for open source.  It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to put a project up and keep an eye out on the statistics it gives about your code.  Also, I recommend checking out simplecov.  It lets you know what percent your test coverage is, and even generates a nice little html report on it too.</p>

<p>I think what&rsquo;s next is: events, which will belong to organizations with a has many relationship. It should be pretty simple.  It&rsquo;ll get more complicated with it&rsquo;s relationship to bakers model, who should be able to sign up for an event.  So a baker will have many events too.</p>

<p>Random thought: One of the speakers at RubyNation was a contributor to RubyGems. He made a comment about this feature that many people in the room used, and how he wrote that completely drunk.</p>

<p>Random vim newbie lesson.  So, today I realized I wanted to add a generic div to most of my html files.  This div would be a wrapper, and allow me to set padding on the body of most of my pages.</p>

<p>Initially, I had started off with a generic div in my application.html.erb file like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='erb'><span class='line'><span class="x">  &lt;div class=&quot;main-container&quot;&gt; </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    </span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="s1">&#39;layouts/alerts&#39;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    </span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This was great, but I needed the option of adjusting the padding specifically for my main page, as I didn&rsquo;t want certain elements to have any padding at all. I&rsquo;m still unsure of if there was an easier way to do it using advanced CSS skills, but I was left with the issue of adding a div to around 10 different html files.</p>

<p>This kind of repetition is where vim excels though, through it&rsquo;s powerful macros.  Here is how I accomplished it.</p>

<ul>
<li>qa &ndash; starts recording a macro at register a</li>
<li>gg &ndash; normalizes the position at the first line</li>
<li>O &ndash; creates a new line above the cursor (so, the first line)</li>
<li>&lt;div class=&ldquo;wrapper&rdquo;>[enter] &ndash; just creating the div</li>
<li>jVG &ndash; moves down one line, enters visual block mode and selects to the last line of the file</li>
<li>> &ndash; indents everything selected once</li>
<li>Go &ndash; moves cursor to last line and adds a new line</li>
<li>&lt;/div>[enter] &ndash; finishes the div</li>
<li>q  &ndash; quits recording</li>
</ul>


<p>This may look a little complicated, but it really wasn&rsquo;t at all. Applying that change to any file was as simple as typing @a.  There are even easier ways to apply the macro to a longer list of files using :argdo, but I wanted to eyeball it. For a deeper look at macros, check out Practical Vim. It definitely saved me a lot of time in this particular instance.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve started to try and build an MVP (minimum viable product).  I&rsquo;m giving myself a week to make and push a fully functional rails app to the web. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of programming in rails already, but it has mostly been following tutorials.  I&rsquo;ve been putting off building something real for lack of any great ideas. So, I&rsquo;ve decided that the idea doesn&rsquo;t matter, just that I build something on my own.  I&rsquo;m not expecting the actual site to get any users; I&rsquo;m more interested in building a fully functional site to add to my portfolio.</p>

<p>My MVP is going to be based around bake sales.  Yup, bake sales.  The problem that my site seeks to answer is that bake sales inherently draw from the members of the organization that is running it.  If there was a way for random bakers to donate their baked goods to organizations, then the organizations could do even better.</p>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;m designing this site expecting to never have any real members, one question I really don&rsquo;t have a solution for is how to deal with food safety/poison. Reviews would be a good place to start..but still doesn&rsquo;t help with newer people? Maybe just encourage organizers to make the baker try a bite of his own food. Maybe adding a verified badge bakers can opt-in on? I guess it&rsquo;s the same problem that a lot of startups like uber and airbnb face;<em> how do you prevent people will ill intent from exploiting your site?</em></p>

<p>What would the baker get out of it besides the warm and fuzzies? Ideally, the site would provide receipts for tax deductions and optionally allow the organization to &ldquo;tip&rdquo; the baker after the sale.</p>

<p>The repository will be evolving <a href="https://github.com/djquan/bake_sale">over here</a>, and eventually I&rsquo;ll launch a functioning version. So far, I&rsquo;ve only added user authentication (through devise) and implemented bootstrap.</p>

<p>Thinking about the logic required, I&rsquo;ll need at least these models:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users # Bakers</li>
<li>Reviews for Users</li>
<li>Organizations</li>
<li>Bake Sales  # Actual events</li>
<li>Baked goods at bake sales</li>
</ul>


<p>Random vim newbie lesson.  Say you have some code like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class =</span><span class="err"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Random CSS selector&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Random example<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and your cursor is at the beginning of the line. How would you go about changing &ldquo;Random example&rdquo; to &ldquo;Another scenario&rdquo; in your editor?  If you are using a mouse, you could always grab it, highlight &ldquo;Random example&rdquo;, and start typing &ldquo;Another scenario&rdquo;.  That doesn&rsquo;t require too much energy or time.</p>

<p>In vim, it&rsquo;s even simpler. The keystrokes would be &ldquo;citAnother scenario<CR>&rdquo;.  No need to go to the mouse, no ned to navigate to it. &ldquo;it&rdquo; is a text object for anything inside tags. By pressing &ldquo;cit&rdquo;, you are telling vim to change inside the tags and it automatically puts you in insert mode. Text objects are great, and they are one of the reasons I use vim.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Kerri Miller spoke about measurement tools. Slides <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kerrizor/you-cant-miss-what-you-cant-measure">here</a>. An interesting tool is <a href="http://ruby.sadi.st/Ruby_Sadist.html">flog</a> which grades you based on code complexity. Aside from code complexity, another metric to keep an eye out on is churn.  Churn, from what I understand, is the amount of times you edit a file.  If you keep on editing a file throughout a project&rsquo;s lifespan, you may not have a firm understanding on what that model/class/method should be doing.</p>

<p>Rich Kilmer spoke about Ruby Motion and Bluetooth 4 integration in Ruby Motion. Ruby Motion definitely seems 1.) capable and 2.) an emerging technology with an active community.  I definitely want to start writing some programs in it.  The second half of his talk was about Bluetooth 4:  BT4 is really a cool technology with a lot of cool potential.  We will start seeing more electronics and gadgets incorporating it, especially since iOS 7 is embracing more of the advanced capabilities of it.</p>

<p>Jim Gay spoke about DCI; this may have been one of the only talks that really went over my head.  DCI stands for Data-Context-Interaction.  On paper, I understand the basics of DCI.  I&rsquo;m just unsure of how to implement it in web development, and even if I should be worrying about that as a beginner.</p>

<p>Evan Light spoke, somewhat pessimistically, about the state of ruby and ROR.  He compared Rails&#8217; current state to where Java was leading up to the moment when people started leaving java for ruby. He spoke about how complex things are becoming and how the community seems to be making some dangerous choices on what gems and technologies are adopted.  Overall, it was pretty interesting; it was clear he really loves ruby and doesn&rsquo;t want it to see the same fate as java.</p>

<p>John Athayde spoke about design patterns.  I enjoyed his talk a lot.  He has an interesting background; he comes from, among other things, a career as an architect.  Developers, for good reasons, like to think of themselves as craftsman and engineers.  His talk focused on architectural theory that could be applied to development. Mainly, in architecture, there are common patterns (like in programming).  These patterns are not a template though, they are an answer to a problem. He also stressed that beginners should focus on code anti-patterns (code smells) rather than code patterns.  Otherwise, beginners will jump straight to copying a pattern when they might not.</p>

<p>A lot of the lightning talks were really well done.  One that sticks out was an introduction to devops. Basically, the speaker said that many people use the word wrong.  Devops is a culture of getting developers and system operators to work together and improve the final product.</p>

<p>Steve Klabnik spoke about taking over maintenance of an open source project under the worst conditions.  It was a good talk, but one thing I particularly enjoyed that he said was <em>getting</em> involved in an open source project as a beginner is not easy.  Many current developers that do open source work say that it is, but there are still barriers to knowing where to begin with it.  Moreover, he also spoke about the negative side of the open source community ~ high demands.  Many people expect your programming to be perfect, but 1.) they aren&rsquo;t committing to it and 2.) You aren&rsquo;t getting paid to do it.</p>

<p>Avdi Grimm ended RubyNation with an awesome talk on code and joy.  Two things that he talked about were 1.) the community and 2.) pair programming.  The ruby community is amazing.  My experience with this conference, and with all the resources online, really convinced me that there aren&rsquo;t many programming communities out there like this, let alone regular communities.  I felt so comfortable just going up to random strangers and introducing myself in a way that I have never before.</p>

<p>I am so thankful for the people organizing RubyNation; it was a great conference with well selected and engaging speakers.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The first day of RubyNation is done, and I thought I&rsquo;d post some things I learned.</p>

<p>Sandi Metz did her talk on the magic tricks of testing; you really should check a <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2452-railsconf2013-the-magic-tricks-of-testing">version</a> of it out.  She, and her book, are amazing for programmers of any level.  This talk is solely on unit testing.  She stresses not over-testing and not repeating test coverage.</p>

<ul>
<li>Test that your objects, when they receive a query or command, respond to them appropriately.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t test private methods.  If you need to, don&rsquo;t get attached to them; delete them when they break.</li>
<li>Test that your object sends a particular command; not exactly the consequences of it as another object will test the side-effects.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t test methods that an object sends to itself. Don&rsquo;t test queries that an object sends to another.</li>
</ul>


<p>Really, check out her talk(and her book!).  It&rsquo;s quite good. I particularly like the analogy of objects as space capsules.</p>

<p>Russ Olsen launched RubyNation with an interesting talk on intuition and those &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moments. He talked a little bit about pair programming, including a nice little rule:</p>

<ul>
<li>if your pair and you are stuck, sit in quiet and don&rsquo;t type for two minutes while thinking through the problems.</li>
</ul>


<p>He also discussed another profession that works in pairs in the same manner: police officers. As a former police officer, I could definitely appreciate the comparison. For a lot of my time with the department, I worked directly with a partner.  We were much more effective as a team than independently.</p>

<p>Emily Stolfo had a nice <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2493-railsconf2013-hacking-the-academic-experience">talk</a> on hacking the academic experience where she listed five traits she tries to teach students:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the internet as a textbook</li>
<li>Able to debug code you didn&rsquo;t write</li>
<li>Build something to solve a real-life problem</li>
<li>Engage with the community</li>
<li>Think critically about code</li>
</ul>


<p>There were a few other memorable talks. Bryan Helmkamp spoke about security in rails applications.  He recommends the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/">Brakeman gem</a> for checking vulnerabilities.  It reviews your code for common (but not all) vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Two people spoke about doing DevOps on President Obama&rsquo;s re-election campaign. Learning about the technologies that went into the campaign was interesting.  It was more from the perspective of a system administrator than a developer, but I still found it helpful in understanding how sites scale.  I&rsquo;ve been focusing on code for the past four months, and it&rsquo;s easy to forget that code is run on machines.  Heroku is fine for playing around with and learning (and it&rsquo;s fine for production environments too), but there are other options and technical considerations when developing a site/application that will actually receive heavy traffic.</p>

<p>I learned a lot, and day two should be just as great. Some final thoughts</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to say you&rsquo;re a complete beginner.  Most people are friendly and want to help.</li>
<li>There are a lot of freelancers out there making a living off contracts ~ Most said that it was really easy to get contracts.</li>
<li>Be friendly and introduce yourself to people.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m doing better with imposter syndrome.  It&rsquo;s easy to think you don&rsquo;t have the skills to belong at the table, but everyone is learning something.  Some people happen to be learning more.</li>
<li>It wouldn&rsquo;t be the worst idea to take handwritten notes.</li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Just a brief review on Code School&rsquo;s first two courses on iOS development.  I definitely believe that they are worth the time.  Objective C and mobile development is new for me, and it was fairly challenging to start off learning a new language (especially one that wasn&rsquo;t as intuitive as ruby). Still, like most challenges, I began to understand it better the more effort I put in.</p>

<p>The technology behind the courses is impressive. Compiling Objective C/iphone code seems more challenging than compiling ruby code.  Code School has it set up so that their machines build and compile your code.  This lets non-mac users actually experiment with iOS development. It also means that it takes a few seconds to see if you made any errors (which was slightly annoying, but also made me double check my code before hitting submit).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also updated the resources section of the site. It&rsquo;s a categorized list of the resources I&rsquo;ve used so far.  Definitely check it out, and feel free to suggest other resources in the comments.</p>

<p>Ruby Nation is tomorrow!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling a little bit with getting into Objective C.  Ruby is really a fun language to program in, and that was one of the goals it was designed for.  I&rsquo;m really appreciating that more as I dive a little into Objective C.  Granted, it is only through the Code School tutorial, so there may be other best practices and ways to do it that actually make it better.  Take for example functions.  This is an example from the tutorial:</p>

<p>This just seems really verbose and not intuitive. I mean, the whole thing in ruby could be as simple as:</p>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;s much more simple, right? No confusing syntax&hellip;no need for explicit variable declarations with type.</p>

<p>Of course the entire code example is trivial in its functionality; but I&rsquo;m sure the point is even more valid the more complex the program will get.</p>

<p>Objective C is still a valuable language to be familiar with, and I fully intend to keep pushing forward on it. I do want to play around with Ruby Motion, but you still need to know your way around objective c for it(since you can use the same APIs and libraries).</p>

		<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>vim is a text editor, but it is so much more too.  This post will go over why vim works <em>for me</em> and my setup, including plugins.</p>

<p>This post will be similar to my <a href="http://quan.io/blog/2013/05/14/tmux/">post on tmux</a>, with an emphasis on the plugins I use and how they fit into my workflow.  I am a beginner;  I still have a tremendous amount of learning about vim, <em>and this post is for fellow beginners out there.</em></p>

<p>This is also not a &ldquo;vim is better than sublime/emacs/textmate/eclipse/rubymine&rdquo; post.  This is just me laying out some thoughts on my experience with vim and my setup.</p>

<p>This is not a guide on how to use vim.  Check out some of the links at the bottom for some good resources.  The <em>best</em> resource on vim (that I have found) is Practical Vim by Drew Neil.</p>

<p>Moreover, this is also serving as a way to downsize my vimrc file by justifying everything in it.</p>

<p>My recommendation is, no matter what editor you use, think about how to improve your workflow and become more efficient.  Is there a way you can do what you want with less keystrokes?  Do you really need to reach for the mouse?  What plugins are your favorite, and are you using them in the best way?  How can you make your editor leaner?</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6565481/vim.png" alt="vim" /></p>

<p><strong>Does a beginner really need to use vim?</strong></p>

<p>No, of course not.  I came to vim only after I felt comfortable with ruby, looking to improve my workflow. My advice: make sure you have that some comfort with whatever language(s) you chose before experimenting with vim.</p>

<p>That said, learning vim early can do a few good things.  So you made a mistake and didn&rsquo;t press a or i to enter insert mode to begin typing.  Well, you can retype it again and have the added bonus of repetition in learning the basics.  You also get the baby-steps and issues of learning vim out of the way, so that when you <em>need</em> to be typing fast with few mistakes, you can.  To put it another way, make your mistakes now in both vim and #{whatever programming language you are learning} so that you won&rsquo;t make them later.</p>

<p><strong>Why should I even bother?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Efficiency &ndash; Modal editing, despite taking a while to get a hang of, can lead to improving efficiency. The mouse, while typing, is the enemy.  The time it takes to move between the mouse and keyboard can add up.</li>
<li>The Dot command &ndash; Vim knows what you did last. Actions, like adding text, deleting lines, can be repeated by pressing . on your keyboard.  This is extremely powerful in programming, where often you need to repeat an action.</li>
<li>Text Objects &ndash;  Text objects, when combined with modal editing, are great.  Say I&rsquo;m typing a sentence, and I want to rewrite the entire thing.  I can press cis anywhere in that sentence to delete it all and throw me into insert mode.  They are pretty cool.</li>
<li>Editing text on a server &ndash; If you haven&rsquo;t already, someday soon any beginner will eventually get to the point where he has to edit text on a server. That server will have vim on it. Any investment, even if you chose to edit with something else primarily, in learning vim can pay off when that comes up.</li>
<li>Command line &ndash; Even without tmux, it is easy to use the command line and all of it&rsquo;s power from the editor itself.</li>
<li>Vim + Tmux = Amazingness</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Plugins</strong> (in no particular order)</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a></em>:
Vundle is a plugin manager. Basically, installing a plugin with it involves adding &lsquo;Bundle &ldquo;github/pathofplugin&rdquo;&rsquo; to your vimrc file, and typing :BundleInstall in vim (after reloading your source file).  Use this or Tim Pope&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> for managing your plugins.  Both are great.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">Ctrl-P</a></em>:
Ctrl-P is a fuzzy file finder for vim. It is quick and efficient. It&rsquo;s much more efficient than &ldquo;:e filename.rb&rdquo; and is my preferred method of finding files.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular">Tabularize</a></em>:
Tabular makes it easy to align text based on a target. There is a nice <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/aligning-text-with-tabular-vim/">vimcast</a> that does a great job explaining this. Basically, if I wanted to align text for variable assignment based on an equal sign, I could just type :Tab /=  and all of the equal signs would be aligned in the same column.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired">Unimpaired</a></em>:
Unimpaired provides handy shortcuts for switching between buffers/args/etc. Instead of pressing &ldquo;:bn&rdquo; to get to the next buffer, unimapired allows you to press [b to get to the next buffer.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/benmills/vimux">vimux</a></em>:
Allows easy integration with tmux.  Bind a leader combo to open up a new tmux pane and run a command in it.  Amazing.  Also, amazing in conjunction with vim-turbux.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/vim-turbux">vim-turbux</a></em>:
See above, automates the process of testing in conjunction with tmux.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise">vim-endwise</a></em>:
Adds &ldquo;end&rdquo; wherever it needs be automatically.  class, def, if, it should do; can handle them all and more.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/townk/vim-autoclose">vim-autoclose</a></em>:
Autocloses parenthesis, brackets, quotes, single quotes, backticks, etc.  Helpful.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle">vim-numbertoggle</a></em>:
This one has grown on me.  I like relative number for ease of navigating.  Relative number lets me not have to count as much.  I don&rsquo;t need relative number on all the time, and numbertoggle switches between them when I go into insert mode.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://github.com/mattn/gist-vim">gist-vim</a></em>:
This one I don&rsquo;t use enough to have anything memorized.  But it is there, and allows easy code sharing when I need it.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a></em>:
An amazing plugin; if you are a heavy git user, this alone might be enough to make you switch to vim. <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim---a-complement-to-command-line-git/">Vimcasts</a> has a nice set of tutorials on using fugitive.  The short of it is: vim-fugitive gives you the history(through git) on changes, files, and commits. Typing :Gdiff opens up a split pane with a line by line colored comparison of changes I have made to a file.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/epmatsw/ag.vim">ag</a></em>:
The vim plugin for integrating the silver searcher.  The Silver Searcher is a replacement for Ack, which is often used instead of grep.  This plugin gives you a nice popup menu for ag searches by typing :Ag &ldquo;searchterm&rdquo;<CR></p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails">vim-rails</a></em>:
This plugin is obviously only good for those rails developers out there.  Enhanced syntax highlighting is nice, but just the tip.  Vim-rails has ways of easily and intelligently navigating the directory ~ it knows your controllers, your models, and your views.  There are more features, but I&rsquo;m still learning them.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">vim-syntastic</a></em>:
Points out syntax errors.  On write(:w), it&rsquo;ll check and throw arrows in the margin of lines it thinks there&rsquo;s issues with.  These issues could be a number of things that it thinks is wrong.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">vim-surround</a></em>:
Another fantastic plugin by Tim Pope.  Say I wanted to change a string declaration from a = &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to a = &lsquo;hello&rsquo;.   I just place my cursor on any letter in hello and type cs&#8221;&lsquo; and it changes it automatically. Especially helpful with changing HTML tags since you can replace things with valid html. It can also add (instead of just changing) with ys[textobject][whatever you want to add].</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/mattn/zencoding-vim">zencoding</a></em>:
Zencoding/Emmet is a way of expanding short bits of code into longform html. Definitely check out the video here, <a href="http://docs.emmet.io/">http://docs.emmet.io/</a> .  It&rsquo;s an extremely efficient way of writing html.</p>

<p>I probably still need a good snippet tool.  I&rsquo;m looking at ultisnip or snipmate; I haven&rsquo;t really felt the need to have one <em>yet</em>.  Vim-Autoclose and endwise help a lot already.  Zencoding handles much of my html needs.</p>

<p><strong> Some helpful .vimrc lines </strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I got all of these from Drew Neil.</p>

<p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>

<p>There is no getting around it:  Vim has a learning curve.  However, it may not be as steep as you think.  It may take a few days for the basic ideas of normal/insert/visual/etc modes to click.  Navigating may be tricky at first.  You may find yourself wishing that you had a mouse on many occasions.  But it passes, and you gain efficiency eventually.</p>

<p>Vim requires out of the box work to get it configured. This is only a negative in the short-term.  In the long term, you have a better understanding of the features in your text editor because you worked to get them there.  I also feel that the small decisions I make in setting it up add up to really make the vim I work on unique and &lsquo;mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember where I heard it from(I think it was the peepcode screencast on vim), but someone said that your .vimrc file is something you can grow old with. Someone also said that if you don&rsquo;t think your .vimrc is the best there is, you need to work on it more.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vim is a highly customizable text editor.  Getting it set up is an extremely personal ordeal, and I would recommend against using packages that advertise to be the ultimate vim distribution.  One of the great things about vim is that at the end of the day, you are left with an editor that is <em>yours</em>.  Get to know your plugins.  Get to know every setting you have and what it does.  This will help you get the most out of it.</p>

<p>If I haven&rsquo;t convinced you to try vim, I hope I have convinced you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Love what editor you do use (we spend enough time on them that this is crucial)</li>
<li>Think of ways you can improve it</li>
<li>Think of ways you can be more efficient</li>
</ul>


<p>There are probably countless amazing plugins I haven&rsquo;t mentioned.  My recommendation: don&rsquo;t get caught up in all the &ldquo;what plugin&rdquo; should I use for x until a little later.  Learn the vim basics, and then go plugin-crazy.  Vim is awesome without plugins; plugins just make it that much more amazing.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve started to dive into some more design resources.</p>

<p>Code School&rsquo;s Journey into Mobile is a pretty good introduction to responsive design. Responsive design is designing your site so that it looks good in varying resolutions and devices.  It is extremely important with the variety of ways people can visit a site. It involves using percentages or ems (relative units in css).  Also, it involves finding &ldquo;break points&rdquo;, resolutions which the site design changes. All in all, it was eye opening at the amount of thought and work that it takes to make a site responsive; especially since tools like Twitter&rsquo;s Bootstrap can hide all the magic of responsive design.</p>

<p>Sass is stylesheet language that compiles into CSS.  It lets you do more with less lines of code.  It&rsquo;s similar to CoffeeScript, in the sense that it 1.) simplifies the syntax and 2.) makes it feel more like a programming language.  For example, the text below is in Sass.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sass'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$authors</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">bob</span> <span class="n">tim</span> <span class="n">sue</span> <span class="n">kate</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.author</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="na">float</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="no">left</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>$authors is a list, which functions much like an array.  You can iterate through it using each, find the index of a value, and many more commands you&rsquo;d expect from an array.  The example above automatically updates the width of a css selector (.author) to adjust to adding new authors.</p>

		<p>Back to learning!</p>

<p>I recommend checking out the Ruby Rogues episode on imposter syndrom.  As someone new to programming, it&rsquo;s nice to hear that even the experts can feel like they don&rsquo;t belong or people will realize that they don&rsquo;t know as much as they should.</p>

<p>I attended Spree Conf in DC; and I definitely felt that I didn&rsquo;t belong, and that created a lot of fear and anxiety. I&rsquo;ve been studying for over four months, and I&rsquo;m fairly accomplished in other areas, but it was still terrifying to be that new person in the room.  This RubyRogues episode definitely has helped my outlook, and I&rsquo;m excited to go to my next conference (RubyNation!).</p>

<p>I recently attended a webinar on vim by Drew Neil, the man who wrote <em>Practical Vim</em>.  I definitely recommend attending; it is easily worth the relatively steep price.  I&rsquo;d read (or skim) the book and check out some of his vimcasts beforehand to get the most out of it.  The major focus points were: Macros and text objects, but I also feel more comfortable just dealing with registers, buffers, and args.</p>

<p>vim helpful tip for your .vimrc.  This lets you use the dot command in visual mode. Great for applying the last change on many lines.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="c">&quot; adds dot command to visual mode &quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">vnoremap</span> . :norm.<span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Say you wanted to add a semicolon to multiple lines.</p>

<p>A;       ~  Appends a semicolon to the current line</p>

<p>vG       ~  Selects to the last line of the file, could easily be a different selector.</p>

<p>.         ~  Appends a semicolon to every line selected.</p>

<p>No idea why this doesn&rsquo;t work out of the box for vim.</p>
