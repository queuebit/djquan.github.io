	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2013/06/14/ruby-nation/" itemprop="url">Ruby Nation, Day I</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The first day of RubyNation is done, and I thought I&rsquo;d post some things I learned.</p>

<p>Sandi Metz did her talk on the magic tricks of testing; you really should check a <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2452-railsconf2013-the-magic-tricks-of-testing">version</a> of it out.  She, and her book, are amazing for programmers of any level.  This talk is solely on unit testing.  She stresses not over-testing and not repeating test coverage.</p>

<ul>
<li>Test that your objects, when they receive a query or command, respond to them appropriately.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t test private methods.  If you need to, don&rsquo;t get attached to them; delete them when they break.</li>
<li>Test that your object sends a particular command; not exactly the consequences of it as another object will test the side-effects.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t test methods that an object sends to itself. Don&rsquo;t test queries that an object sends to another.</li>
</ul>


<p>Really, check out her talk(and her book!).  It&rsquo;s quite good. I particularly like the analogy of objects as space capsules.</p>

<p>Russ Olsen launched RubyNation with an interesting talk on intuition and those &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moments. He talked a little bit about pair programming, including a nice little rule:</p>

<ul>
<li>if your pair and you are stuck, sit in quiet and don&rsquo;t type for two minutes while thinking through the problems.</li>
</ul>


<p>He also discussed another profession that works in pairs in the same manner: police officers. As a former police officer, I could definitely appreciate the comparison. For a lot of my time with the department, I worked directly with a partner.  We were much more effective as a team than independently.</p>

<p>Emily Stolfo had a nice <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2493-railsconf2013-hacking-the-academic-experience">talk</a> on hacking the academic experience where she listed five traits she tries to teach students:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the internet as a textbook</li>
<li>Able to debug code you didn&rsquo;t write</li>
<li>Build something to solve a real-life problem</li>
<li>Engage with the community</li>
<li>Think critically about code</li>
</ul>


<p>There were a few other memorable talks. Bryan Helmkamp spoke about security in rails applications.  He recommends the <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/">Brakeman gem</a> for checking vulnerabilities.  It reviews your code for common (but not all) vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Two people spoke about doing DevOps on President Obama&rsquo;s re-election campaign. Learning about the technologies that went into the campaign was interesting.  It was more from the perspective of a system administrator than a developer, but I still found it helpful in understanding how sites scale.  I&rsquo;ve been focusing on code for the past four months, and it&rsquo;s easy to forget that code is run on machines.  Heroku is fine for playing around with and learning (and it&rsquo;s fine for production environments too), but there are other options and technical considerations when developing a site/application that will actually receive heavy traffic.</p>

<p>I learned a lot, and day two should be just as great. Some final thoughts</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to say you&rsquo;re a complete beginner.  Most people are friendly and want to help.</li>
<li>There are a lot of freelancers out there making a living off contracts ~ Most said that it was really easy to get contracts.</li>
<li>Be friendly and introduce yourself to people.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m doing better with imposter syndrome.  It&rsquo;s easy to think you don&rsquo;t have the skills to belong at the table, but everyone is learning something.  Some people happen to be learning more.</li>
<li>It wouldn&rsquo;t be the worst idea to take handwritten notes.</li>
</ul>


<p>Random unrelated vim tip:</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Just a brief review on Code School&rsquo;s first two courses on iOS development.  I definitely believe that they are worth the time.  Objective C and mobile development is new for me, and it was fairly challenging to start off learning a new language (especially one that wasn&rsquo;t as intuitive as ruby). Still, like most challenges, I began to understand it better the more effort I put in.</p>

<p>The technology behind the courses is impressive. Compiling Objective C/iphone code seems more challenging than compiling ruby code.  Code School has it set up so that their machines build and compile your code.  This lets non-mac users actually experiment with iOS development. It also means that it takes a few seconds to see if you made any errors (which was slightly annoying, but also made me double check my code before hitting submit).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also updated the resources section of the site. It&rsquo;s a categorized list of the resources I&rsquo;ve used so far.  Definitely check it out, and feel free to suggest other resources in the comments.</p>

<p>Ruby Nation is tomorrow!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling a little bit with getting into Objective C.  Ruby is really a fun language to program in, and that was one of the goals it was designed for.  I&rsquo;m really appreciating that more as I dive a little into Objective C.  Granted, it is only through the Code School tutorial, so there may be other best practices and ways to do it that actually make it better.  Take for example functions.  This is an example from the tutorial:</p>

<p>This just seems really verbose and not intuitive. I mean, the whole thing in ruby could be as simple as:</p>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;s much more simple, right? No confusing syntax&hellip;no need for explicit variable declarations with type.</p>

<p>Of course the entire code example is trivial in its functionality; but I&rsquo;m sure the point is even more valid the more complex the program will get.</p>

<p>Objective C is still a valuable language to be familiar with, and I fully intend to keep pushing forward on it. I do want to play around with Ruby Motion, but you still need to know your way around objective c for it(since you can use the same APIs and libraries).</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>vim is a text editor, but it is so much more too.  This post will go over why vim works <em>for me</em> and my setup, including plugins.</p>

<p>This post will be similar to my <a href="http://quan.io/blog/2013/05/14/tmux/">post on tmux</a>, with an emphasis on the plugins I use and how they fit into my workflow.  I am a beginner;  I still have a tremendous amount of learning about vim, <em>and this post is for fellow beginners out there.</em></p>

<p>This is also not a &ldquo;vim is better than sublime/emacs/textmate/eclipse/rubymine&rdquo; post.  This is just me laying out some thoughts on my experience with vim and my setup.</p>

<p>This is not a guide on how to use vim.  Check out some of the links at the bottom for some good resources.  The <em>best</em> resource on vim (that I have found) is Practical Vim by Drew Neil.</p>

<p>Moreover, this is also serving as a way to downsize my vimrc file by justifying everything in it.</p>

<p>My recommendation is, no matter what editor you use, think about how to improve your workflow and become more efficient.  Is there a way you can do what you want with less keystrokes?  Do you really need to reach for the mouse?  What plugins are your favorite, and are you using them in the best way?  How can you make your editor leaner?</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6565481/vim.png" alt="vim" /></p>

<p><strong>Does a beginner really need to use vim?</strong></p>

<p>No, of course not.  I came to vim only after I felt comfortable with ruby, looking to improve my workflow. My advice: make sure you have that some comfort with whatever language(s) you chose before experimenting with vim.</p>

<p>That said, learning vim early can do a few good things.  So you made a mistake and didn&rsquo;t press a or i to enter insert mode to begin typing.  Well, you can retype it again and have the added bonus of repetition in learning the basics.  You also get the baby-steps and issues of learning vim out of the way, so that when you <em>need</em> to be typing fast with few mistakes, you can.  To put it another way, make your mistakes now in both vim and #{whatever programming language you are learning} so that you won&rsquo;t make them later.</p>

<p><strong>Why should I even bother?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Efficiency &ndash; Modal editing, despite taking a while to get a hang of, can lead to improving efficiency. The mouse, while typing, is the enemy.  The time it takes to move between the mouse and keyboard can add up.</li>
<li>The Dot command &ndash; Vim knows what you did last. Actions, like adding text, deleting lines, can be repeated by pressing . on your keyboard.  This is extremely powerful in programming, where often you need to repeat an action.</li>
<li>Text Objects &ndash;  Text objects, when combined with modal editing, are great.  Say I&rsquo;m typing a sentence, and I want to rewrite the entire thing.  I can press cis anywhere in that sentence to delete it all and throw me into insert mode.  They are pretty cool.</li>
<li>Editing text on a server &ndash; If you haven&rsquo;t already, someday soon any beginner will eventually get to the point where he has to edit text on a server. That server will have vim on it. Any investment, even if you chose to edit with something else primarily, in learning vim can pay off when that comes up.</li>
<li>Command line &ndash; Even without tmux, it is easy to use the command line and all of it&rsquo;s power from the editor itself.</li>
<li>Vim + Tmux = Amazingness</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Plugins</strong> (in no particular order)</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a></em>:
Vundle is a plugin manager. Basically, installing a plugin with it involves adding &lsquo;Bundle &ldquo;github/pathofplugin&rdquo;&rsquo; to your vimrc file, and typing :BundleInstall in vim (after reloading your source file).  Use this or Tim Pope&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> for managing your plugins.  Both are great.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">Ctrl-P</a></em>:
Ctrl-P is a fuzzy file finder for vim. It is quick and efficient. It&rsquo;s much more efficient than &ldquo;:e filename.rb&rdquo; and is my preferred method of finding files.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular">Tabularize</a></em>:
Tabular makes it easy to align text based on a target. There is a nice <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/aligning-text-with-tabular-vim/">vimcast</a> that does a great job explaining this. Basically, if I wanted to align text for variable assignment based on an equal sign, I could just type :Tab /=  and all of the equal signs would be aligned in the same column.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired">Unimpaired</a></em>:
Unimpaired provides handy shortcuts for switching between buffers/args/etc. Instead of pressing &ldquo;:bn&rdquo; to get to the next buffer, unimapired allows you to press [b to get to the next buffer.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/benmills/vimux">vimux</a></em>:
Allows easy integration with tmux.  Bind a leader combo to open up a new tmux pane and run a command in it.  Amazing.  Also, amazing in conjunction with vim-turbux.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/vim-turbux">vim-turbux</a></em>:
See above, automates the process of testing in conjunction with tmux.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise">vim-endwise</a></em>:
Adds &ldquo;end&rdquo; wherever it needs be automatically.  class, def, if, it should do; can handle them all and more.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/townk/vim-autoclose">vim-autoclose</a></em>:
Autocloses parenthesis, brackets, quotes, single quotes, backticks, etc.  Helpful.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle">vim-numbertoggle</a></em>:
This one has grown on me.  I like relative number for ease of navigating.  Relative number lets me not have to count as much.  I don&rsquo;t need relative number on all the time, and numbertoggle switches between them when I go into insert mode.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://github.com/mattn/gist-vim">gist-vim</a></em>:
This one I don&rsquo;t use enough to have anything memorized.  But it is there, and allows easy code sharing when I need it.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a></em>:
An amazing plugin; if you are a heavy git user, this alone might be enough to make you switch to vim. <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim---a-complement-to-command-line-git/">Vimcasts</a> has a nice set of tutorials on using fugitive.  The short of it is: vim-fugitive gives you the history(through git) on changes, files, and commits. Typing :Gdiff opens up a split pane with a line by line colored comparison of changes I have made to a file.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/epmatsw/ag.vim">ag</a></em>:
The vim plugin for integrating the silver searcher.  The Silver Searcher is a replacement for Ack, which is often used instead of grep.  This plugin gives you a nice popup menu for ag searches by typing :Ag &ldquo;searchterm&rdquo;<CR></p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails">vim-rails</a></em>:
This plugin is obviously only good for those rails developers out there.  Enhanced syntax highlighting is nice, but just the tip.  Vim-rails has ways of easily and intelligently navigating the directory ~ it knows your controllers, your models, and your views.  There are more features, but I&rsquo;m still learning them.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">vim-syntastic</a></em>:
Points out syntax errors.  On write(:w), it&rsquo;ll check and throw arrows in the margin of lines it thinks there&rsquo;s issues with.  These issues could be a number of things that it thinks is wrong.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">vim-surround</a></em>:
Another fantastic plugin by Tim Pope.  Say I wanted to change a string declaration from a = &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to a = &lsquo;hello&rsquo;.   I just place my cursor on any letter in hello and type cs&#8221;&lsquo; and it changes it automatically. Especially helpful with changing HTML tags since you can replace things with valid html. It can also add (instead of just changing) with ys[textobject][whatever you want to add].</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/mattn/zencoding-vim">zencoding</a></em>:
Zencoding/Emmet is a way of expanding short bits of code into longform html. Definitely check out the video here, <a href="http://docs.emmet.io/">http://docs.emmet.io/</a> .  It&rsquo;s an extremely efficient way of writing html.</p>

<p>I probably still need a good snippet tool.  I&rsquo;m looking at ultisnip or snipmate; I haven&rsquo;t really felt the need to have one <em>yet</em>.  Vim-Autoclose and endwise help a lot already.  Zencoding handles much of my html needs.</p>

<p><strong> Some helpful .vimrc lines </strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I got all of these from Drew Neil.</p>

<p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>

<p>There is no getting around it:  Vim has a learning curve.  However, it may not be as steep as you think.  It may take a few days for the basic ideas of normal/insert/visual/etc modes to click.  Navigating may be tricky at first.  You may find yourself wishing that you had a mouse on many occasions.  But it passes, and you gain efficiency eventually.</p>

<p>Vim requires out of the box work to get it configured. This is only a negative in the short-term.  In the long term, you have a better understanding of the features in your text editor because you worked to get them there.  I also feel that the small decisions I make in setting it up add up to really make the vim I work on unique and &lsquo;mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember where I heard it from(I think it was the peepcode screencast on vim), but someone said that your .vimrc file is something you can grow old with. Someone also said that if you don&rsquo;t think your .vimrc is the best there is, you need to work on it more.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vim is a highly customizable text editor.  Getting it set up is an extremely personal ordeal, and I would recommend against using packages that advertise to be the ultimate vim distribution.  One of the great things about vim is that at the end of the day, you are left with an editor that is <em>yours</em>.  Get to know your plugins.  Get to know every setting you have and what it does.  This will help you get the most out of it.</p>

<p>If I haven&rsquo;t convinced you to try vim, I hope I have convinced you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Love what editor you do use (we spend enough time on them that this is crucial)</li>
<li>Think of ways you can improve it</li>
<li>Think of ways you can be more efficient</li>
</ul>


<p>There are probably countless amazing plugins I haven&rsquo;t mentioned.  My recommendation: don&rsquo;t get caught up in all the &ldquo;what plugin&rdquo; should I use for x until a little later.  Learn the vim basics, and then go plugin-crazy.  Vim is awesome without plugins; plugins just make it that much more amazing.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve started to dive into some more design resources.</p>

<p>Code School&rsquo;s Journey into Mobile is a pretty good introduction to responsive design. Responsive design is designing your site so that it looks good in varying resolutions and devices.  It is extremely important with the variety of ways people can visit a site. It involves using percentages or ems (relative units in css).  Also, it involves finding &ldquo;break points&rdquo;, resolutions which the site design changes. All in all, it was eye opening at the amount of thought and work that it takes to make a site responsive; especially since tools like Twitter&rsquo;s Bootstrap can hide all the magic of responsive design.</p>

<p>Sass is stylesheet language that compiles into CSS.  It lets you do more with less lines of code.  It&rsquo;s similar to CoffeeScript, in the sense that it 1.) simplifies the syntax and 2.) makes it feel more like a programming language.  For example, the text below is in Sass.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sass'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$authors</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">bob</span> <span class="n">tim</span> <span class="n">sue</span> <span class="n">kate</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.author</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="na">float</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="no">left</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="na">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="kt">%</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="nf">length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$authors</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">// automatically updates if $authors changes</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>$authors is a list, which functions much like an array.  You can iterate through it using each, find the index of a value, and many more commands you&rsquo;d expect from an array.  The example above automatically updates the width of a css selector (.author) to adjust to adding new authors.</p>

		<p>Back to learning!</p>

<p>I recommend checking out the Ruby Rogues episode on imposter syndrom.  As someone new to programming, it&rsquo;s nice to hear that even the experts can feel like they don&rsquo;t belong or people will realize that they don&rsquo;t know as much as they should.</p>

<p>I attended Spree Conf in DC; and I definitely felt that I didn&rsquo;t belong, and that created a lot of fear and anxiety. I&rsquo;ve been studying for over four months, and I&rsquo;m fairly accomplished in other areas, but it was still terrifying to be that new person in the room.  This RubyRogues episode definitely has helped my outlook, and I&rsquo;m excited to go to my next conference (RubyNation!).</p>

<p>I recently attended a webinar on vim by Drew Neil, the man who wrote <em>Practical Vim</em>.  I definitely recommend attending; it is easily worth the relatively steep price.  I&rsquo;d read (or skim) the book and check out some of his vimcasts beforehand to get the most out of it.  The major focus points were: Macros and text objects, but I also feel more comfortable just dealing with registers, buffers, and args.</p>

<p>vim helpful tip for your .vimrc.  This lets you use the dot command in visual mode. Great for applying the last change on many lines.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="c">&quot; adds dot command to visual mode &quot;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Say you wanted to add a semicolon to multiple lines.</p>

<p>A;       ~  Appends a semicolon to the current line</p>

<p>vG       ~  Selects to the last line of the file, could easily be a different selector.</p>

<p>.         ~  Appends a semicolon to every line selected.</p>

<p>No idea why this doesn&rsquo;t work out of the box for vim.</p>

		<p>This will probably be my last update for about a week.  I&rsquo;m driving cross country on monday, so I won&rsquo;t have too much time to update the blog.  I do plan on learning more through various audio podcasts during the drive.  Some of them include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Changelog</li>
<li>RubyRogues</li>
<li>Giant Robots Smashing into Other Giant Robots</li>
<li>Ruby Freelancers</li>
<li>Javascript Jabber</li>
</ul>


<p>Feel free to post suggestions in the comments section. Learning to program is inherently visual and tactile, but there must be some other good audio only resources out there.  It is too bad there aren&rsquo;t many audio versions of technical books.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written a bit on Thoughtbot&rsquo;s Learn Prime.  This week, they had a pretty awesome &ldquo;Ask Me Anything&rdquo; session with Ben Orenstein. More features like this would definitely make Learn Prime appealing after I have finished all of their workshops.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve signed up for an online <a href="http://vimcasts.org/classes/core-vim">vim seminar</a> on June 3rd that should raise my vim skills to the next level. I&rsquo;ll be sure to post my thoughts on that.</p>

<p>Web development is much more than knowing how to write a Ruby on Rails app.  Learning javascript well is becoming a major priority for me.  Javascript isn&rsquo;t the prettiest language, but a lot of the exciting frameworks (backbone, ember, node, angular) rely on it.</p>

<p>Node.js is a server-side system of responding to events quickly and reliably. I definitely recommend the Code School course on it.  It was one of the more challenging courses, and I learned more because of that.</p>

		<p>The RubyNation <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/schedule">Speaker List</a> looks amazing. Sandi Metz, Avdi Grimm, Russ Olsen, Steve Klabnik&hellip;I&rsquo;m definitely excited about it.</p>

<p>CoffeScript is a language that compiles into javascript.  The Code School course on CoffeeScript was a nice introduction to it, and it was also a good refresher on basic javascript.  The course has a lot of examples of translating from javascript and jquery into pure coffeescript, which I found really helpful.</p>

<p>There is a lot <a href="http://wekeroad.com/2012/03/21/coffeescript-or-straight-up-js-i-suck-either-way/">written</a> about the pros and cons of CoffeeScript weighed against pure JavaScript. I do like that CoffeeScript appears to be more similar in syntax to Ruby. I don&rsquo;t look it as a JavaScript vs CoffeeScript choice.  To write well in CoffeeScript, you need to have a firm understanding of basic JavaScript to debug errors and really understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve done a fair amount of coding(and blogging) using vim exclusively, and I&rsquo;ve been thrilled with how it&rsquo;s going.  I&rsquo;ve improved my efficiency by not having to switch windows to perform tests, rake tasks, or any other command line work.  Moreover, being able to work quickly without using the mouse at all is liberating.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still reading through <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">Practical Vim</a>, and it&rsquo;s been a great resource so far. I still need to learn more about registers (vim&rsquo;s tools to copy and paste).  I also still need to find a snippet(ways of expanding text) solution that works well for me.  Still, I can&rsquo;t see myself moving away from vim+tmux anytime soon.</p>

		<p>The Ruby Rogues episode on <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/105-rr-regular-expressions-with-nell-shamrell/">regular expressions</a> is pretty awesome. Regular expressions are a way to express patterns in a programming language.  Regular expressions are powerful, but can be very intimidating. <a href="http://rubular.com">Rubular</a> is a nice tool to play around with them, and the chapter on regular expressions in <em>The Well Grounded Rubyist</em> provides a great explanation.</p>

<p>I passed the CA bar exam! That being said, landing a job as a web developer is still my number one goal.  Being a lawyer will be just another skill that I bring to the table.  This means that I&rsquo;ll need to find resources to learn about laws and regulations that affect start-ups. Being a web developer that can also handle routine and simple legal issues will help me stand out.  Web Developer / Counsel would be a nice job title.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lawline.com/">Lawline</a> might be a good resource to learn more. I tried a course on them about negotating SaaS deals which was pretty informative. A general theme of the video was to be explicit about every provision, including confidentiality and ownership. The instructor also stated that the majority of contracts created by tech vendors are pretty horrible because companies tend to reuse old contract and they aren&rsquo;t clear on the intent of the agreement.</p>

<p>Heads up, Code School will be <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/free-weekend?fb_action_ids=10201128707883052&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_ref=.UZaSvvvXBpk.send&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582">free</a> May 25th to May 26th.

		<p>One of the great things about the ruby (and software community in general) is that there are a lot of resources available to learn from.</p>

<p><a href="http://destroyallsoftware.com">Destroy All Software</a> has just made the screencasts available for purchase by season. They weren&rsquo;t available for the past few months while Gary Bernhardt switched pricing models.  I&rsquo;m working through the first season right now and am learning a lot.  It&rsquo;s almost worth it alone to see how fast and efficient he is with vim.</p>

<p>Vim tip: Relative numbers is a <a href="http://forum.thoughtbot.com/t/give-set-relativenumber-a-try/22">winner</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>I like using the <a href="https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle">numbertoggle</a> plugin. It automatically switches to absolute numbers when I switch to insert mode, and it switches back to relative numbers when I leave.</p>
