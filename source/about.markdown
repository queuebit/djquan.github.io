<p>Welcome!  I’m Dan, and I’m an aspiring web developer.  This site chronicles my experience in becoming one.</p>
<p>I graduated law school in 2011 from American University - Washington College of Law.  I decided I wanted some adventures and became a cop in Baltimore City, one of the most dangerous places in the country.  I resigned because I wanted some new intellectual challenges and I was tired of the constant violence.</p>
<p>I have always loved technology and programming, and I am now focusing on gaining the skills necessary to be a web developer.  To that end, I have been teaching myself and I have listed some of the resources I have used under “Curriculum.”  </p>
<p>In September, I will be attending App Academy in San Francisco.  App Academy is a nine week intensive (110+ hours per week) course designed to ensure graduates have what it takes to be hired as a junior web developer.  </p>
