<p>There are a lot of javascript frameworks out there. &nbsp;<a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/27/journey-through-the-javascript-mvc-jungle/">This article</a> and <a href="http://todomvc.com/">this site</a> helped to clear up some of my confusion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just had my first introduction to these frameworks/libraries with Code School's Anatomy of Backbone.js, Part I. &nbsp;<span>Like most of their courses, it was a good </span><strong>introduction</strong><span> to the material that convinced me that I need to learn a lot more about it.</span></p>
<p>PeepCode has released a new screencast on troubleshooting; it was pretty informative. &nbsp;They created a graphic on it <a href="https://peepcode.com/blog/2013/seven-troubleshooting-strategies-poster/img/7strategiesposter.pdf">here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mackup, as described in the <a href="http://quan.io/post/50178150864/obligatory-first-pull-request-post-for-those-that">previous post</a>, was featured on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/mackup-backs-up-and-syncs-your-application-settings-acr-504512985">lifehacker</a>!</p>
