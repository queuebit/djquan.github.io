I will slowly be making a move from tumblr to octopress. 

Octopress is a framework built on Jekyll, a static blog generator. 

I think as I get more familiar with it, the switch to octopress will allow me a greater ability to customize the site.
Moreover, octopress (and jekyll) allow me a greater freedom in how I write my posts. 

I have been trying for the past few hours on ways of importing my older posts from tumblr.  I've tried a variety of methods, including [jekyll-import](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/)
but have run into issues.  I'll keep playing around with it though!
