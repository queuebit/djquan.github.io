<p><p><span>A major lesson I&#8217;ve learned from experimenting with vim is that efficiency does matter, no matter the editor.  The tools a person chooses are important, and it&#8217;s important to be efficient and precise with them.  </span></p>
<p>In vimadventures, they have these levels where you have to accomplish certain editing and navigating texts within a certain number of keystrokes. The goal is to make you think about it now, so that it can be engrained later.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still up in the air about making it my primary editor, but it has changed the way I approach Sublime Text.  I&#8217;m constantly asking, is there a way I can do <em>x </em>without reaching for the mouse and without pressing too many keys.   To rephrase an earlier statement, the tools a person chooses are important, but it&#8217;s more important to be efficient and precise with them than choosing the perfect one. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/manual">manual</a> by hacker school is pretty awesome.  The parts on social rules and pair programming are worth a gander.</p>
<p>Toying around with moving the &#8220;Curriculum&#8221; session <a href="https://trello.com/b/NApK9yRl">to a Trello board</a>.  It&#8217;s easier to maintain, allows any trello user to comment, and will help me get used to trello.</p>

<li>Spent a lot of time trying to get an efficient workflow&#8230;went back and forth between vim and ST2 a lot.  I&#8217;m working on posting <a href="https://trello.com/board/my-setup/5181b0017dca609775002b0d">my current setup </a>with both on trello.  </li>
