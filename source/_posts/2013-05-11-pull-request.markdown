<p>Obligatory first pull request post! For those that don't know, a pull request is a way of contributing back to the open source community. &nbsp;You request that the creator/maintainer&nbsp;of a particular piece of software incorporate your code into the overall code to add a feature or fix a bug. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My first pull request was to <a href="https://github.com/lra/mackup">mackup</a>, a program that lets you keep all your dotfiles (specific configuration files for a variety of apps) in sync through Dropbox. &nbsp;This is an entirely easy thing to do without this software through creating symbolic links, but mackup automates this process, cutting down a lot of time and commands. &nbsp;My contribution was adding support for tmuxinator and teamocil dotfiles. &nbsp;It was only about five lines of additional code, but it still feels good to add features onto a piece of software I use regularly. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, I'll recommend Thoughtbot's Learn Prime. &nbsp;I'm currently doing their Test Driven Rails course, and it has been pretty informative so far. &nbsp;It's also pretty nice to learn about testing from one of the contributors to FactoryGirl. &nbsp;With learn prime, you get posting privileges to the new <a href="http://forum.thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot forums</a>. &nbsp;It's pretty nice having a a lifeline to the thoughtbot team(including the chat pytel, the ceo, and ben orenstein) on any topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do any kind of front end text editing, Emmet (formerly zen-coding) is definitely <a href="http://docs.emmet.io/">worth a look.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
