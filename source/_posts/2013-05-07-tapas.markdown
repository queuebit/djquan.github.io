<p><p>Ruby Tapas are short screencasts that cover small topics of the Ruby language.   Access to them is $9/month, and the creator (Avdi Grimm) releases three per week.   Go to the site and listen to any number of the free ones he provides and you will realize that it is a great bargain.  I&#8217;m currently working my way through them all and learning a lot. </p>
<p><a href="http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby">Test First Ruby</a> is a pretty interesting way to practice programming.  It&#8217;s a lot like RubyKoans in the sense that it relies on TDD.  There are many chapters with different objects.  For example, one chapter has you create a pig-latin converter.  Another tasks you to create a Reverse Polish Notion calculator.   Some are a lot simpler, like extending the Array class to add a function (of course, whether doing so is a smart idea is another thing). </p>
<p>A goal for the coming week is to check out some front-end resources.  I love playing around and programming in Ruby, but it&#8217;s not the only thing I need to learn well. </p>
<p>Log for 5/2 - 5/7</p>
<ul><li>Ruby Tapas - #1 - 10</li>
<li>Completed Test First Ruby</li>
</ul></p>
