<p><p><span>I finished Thoughtbot&#8217;s Intermediate Ruby on Rails Workshop.  I, without a doubt, learned a lot from it.  I</span><span>t works out to being $100 with a Learn Prime subscription.   For that price, you get the material (approximately four hours of video), and constant access to the instructor and office hours every week.  I&#8217;d recommend this workshop for this access more than the content (which was quite good too).   I&#8217;m going to be their taking online Test Driven Rails Workshop in May. </span></p>
<p>The Well Grounded Rubyist is an amazing book.  I have a much better understanding of Ruby after reading it.   The first half of the book really prepares you for the second, and it goes from good to amazing in Chapter 10: Enumerables.   It is a long book, but I highly recommend taking a look as it greatly enhanced my comprehension (and love) of Ruby.  </p>
<ul><li><span>Learning more about regular expressions and MatchData has definitely made them less scary(and kind of exciting!).  </span></li>
<li><span>Learning more about the enumerable module gives me a better picture of when to use each method.   Also, knowing that anything can be made to be enumerable-like by adding one method (and an include) is exciting. </span></li>
</ul><p><span>I&#8217;m playing around with zsh (and oh-my-zsh), and I really like it so far.  Tons of great functionality right from installing it.</span></p>
<p>I also started playing around with vim; I&#8217;m not as sure about that, but it&#8217;s getting more appealing the more I learn.  I figure, even if I don&#8217;t end up using it as my full-time text editor (ST2 is so shiny), it&#8217;s still good to have a grasp of it.  Although as I&#8217;m writing this, <a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/">xkcd&#8217;s newest comic</a> asks how long can you work on making a routine task more efficient before you&#8217;re spending more time than you save.</p>
<p>Project Euler gives language agnostic coding challenges requiring you to create code to help you set up a math problem.  For example, find all the sum of the even Fibonacci numbers up to four million.  They&#8217;re great exercises to work through to help improve basic programming.  </p>
