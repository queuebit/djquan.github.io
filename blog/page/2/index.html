		<p><p>Ruby Tapas are short screencasts that cover small topics of the Ruby language.   Access to them is $9/month, and the creator (Avdi Grimm) releases three per week.   Go to the site and listen to any number of the free ones he provides and you will realize that it is a great bargain.  I&#8217;m currently working my way through them all and learning a lot. </p>
<p><a href="http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby">Test First Ruby</a> is a pretty interesting way to practice programming.  It&#8217;s a lot like RubyKoans in the sense that it relies on TDD.  There are many chapters with different objects.  For example, one chapter has you create a pig-latin converter.  Another tasks you to create a Reverse Polish Notion calculator.   Some are a lot simpler, like extending the Array class to add a function (of course, whether doing so is a smart idea is another thing). </p>
<p>A goal for the coming week is to check out some front-end resources.  I love playing around and programming in Ruby, but it&#8217;s not the only thing I need to learn well. </p>
<p>Log for 5/2 - 5/7</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><p><span>A major lesson I&#8217;ve learned from experimenting with vim is that efficiency does matter, no matter the editor.  The tools a person chooses are important, and it&#8217;s important to be efficient and precise with them.  </span></p>
<p>In vimadventures, they have these levels where you have to accomplish certain editing and navigating texts within a certain number of keystrokes. The goal is to make you think about it now, so that it can be engrained later.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still up in the air about making it my primary editor, but it has changed the way I approach Sublime Text.  I&#8217;m constantly asking, is there a way I can do <em>x </em>without reaching for the mouse and without pressing too many keys.   To rephrase an earlier statement, the tools a person chooses are important, but it&#8217;s more important to be efficient and precise with them than choosing the perfect one. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/manual">manual</a> by hacker school is pretty awesome.  The parts on social rules and pair programming are worth a gander.</p>
<p>Toying around with moving the &#8220;Curriculum&#8221; session <a href="https://trello.com/b/NApK9yRl">to a Trello board</a>.  It&#8217;s easier to maintain, allows any trello user to comment, and will help me get used to trello.</p>
<p>Log for 4/30 - 5/1</p>
<ul><li>Started Test-First-Ruby</li>
<li><a href="https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/">Tuts+ tutorial</a> on setting up a good ST2 workflow</li>
<li>Spent a lot of time trying to get an efficient workflow&#8230;went back and forth between vim and ST2 a lot.  I&#8217;m working on posting <a href="https://trello.com/board/my-setup/5181b0017dca609775002b0d">my current setup </a>with both on trello.  </li>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><p><span>I finished Thoughtbot&#8217;s Intermediate Ruby on Rails Workshop.  I, without a doubt, learned a lot from it.  I</span><span>t works out to being $100 with a Learn Prime subscription.   For that price, you get the material (approximately four hours of video), and constant access to the instructor and office hours every week.  I&#8217;d recommend this workshop for this access more than the content (which was quite good too).   I&#8217;m going to be their taking online Test Driven Rails Workshop in May. </span></p>
<p>The Well Grounded Rubyist is an amazing book.  I have a much better understanding of Ruby after reading it.   The first half of the book really prepares you for the second, and it goes from good to amazing in Chapter 10: Enumerables.   It is a long book, but I highly recommend taking a look as it greatly enhanced my comprehension (and love) of Ruby.  </p>
<ul><li><span>Learning more about regular expressions and MatchData has definitely made them less scary(and kind of exciting!).  </span></li>
<li><span>Learning more about the enumerable module gives me a better picture of when to use each method.   Also, knowing that anything can be made to be enumerable-like by adding one method (and an include) is exciting. </span></li>
</ul><p><span>I&#8217;m playing around with zsh (and oh-my-zsh), and I really like it so far.  Tons of great functionality right from installing it.</span></p>
<p>I also started playing around with vim; I&#8217;m not as sure about that, but it&#8217;s getting more appealing the more I learn.  I figure, even if I don&#8217;t end up using it as my full-time text editor (ST2 is so shiny), it&#8217;s still good to have a grasp of it.  Although as I&#8217;m writing this, <a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/">xkcd&#8217;s newest comic</a> asks how long can you work on making a routine task more efficient before you&#8217;re spending more time than you save.</p>
<p>Project Euler gives language agnostic coding challenges requiring you to create code to help you set up a math problem.  For example, find all the sum of the even Fibonacci numbers up to four million.  They&#8217;re great exercises to work through to help improve basic programming.  </p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2013/04/21/app-academy/" itemprop="url">App Academy</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have been accepted and will attend <a href="http://www.appacademy.io/">App Academy</a> in September. &nbsp;App Academy is a <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/03/free-learn-to-code-boot-camp/">well respected</a>&nbsp;&#8220;bootcamp&#8221; for web development. &nbsp;Having been through a fairly difficult police academy, using the term bootcamp for a programming course is difficult for me&#8230;.but I have no doubt that it will be among the most difficult challenges I have tackled.</p>


<p>I feel really lucky and blessed that I was accepted there. &nbsp;It does seem to be appear one of the hardest programs to get into. &nbsp;My suggestion for those applying to any of the programs is to learn the basics of ruby before applying. This will show that you are passionate about programming, and will help you get through any technical tests. &nbsp; My other suggestion is to not freak out about the technical tests; just talk your way through it. &nbsp;It is okay to make mistakes.</p>


<p>This site has been mainly documenting my journey of learning on my own. I feel that the &#8220;bootcamp&#8221; model that is rapidly expanding is right <em>for me</em> for the following reasons.&nbsp;</p>


<ul>
<li>Accelerating and focusing learning</li>
<li>Gaining experience with the soft skills of development</li>
<li>To gain credibility when applying for junior developer jobs.</li>
</ul>


<p>Furthermore, App Academy in SF seems like the perfect choice for me.</p>


<ul>
<li>Location. &nbsp; San Francisco is the heart of the tech industry, and living and learning in SF will be key to getting an entry level job.</li>
<li>Business model. &nbsp; App Academy collects tuition as a percentage of your first year&#8217;s salary. &nbsp; The majority of&nbsp;tuition&nbsp;is due after, is comparable to other developer bootcamps, and is only due if they succeed in teaching you. &nbsp;This is&nbsp;immensely&nbsp;more&nbsp;affordable&nbsp;than paying $7-12+k before attending the first day.</li>
<li>Business model. &nbsp;App Academy&#8217;s business model shows their commitment to&nbsp;<em>each&nbsp;</em>individual student&#8217;s success.</li>
<li>One cohort at a time. &nbsp;It seems the cycles do not overlap, leading to the focus being your class&#8217; progress as a whole. &nbsp;Dev Bootcamp, on the other hand, often has at least three cohorts running at once.</li>
</ul>


<p><span>This upcoming journey is very exciting, but also pretty terrifying. &nbsp;Not only am I pursuing a different career, but I also will be uprooting myself from my life in DC, where I have lived for over 7 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span>With that said, this blog will continue to show how I am learning web development on my own until September. &nbsp; Once App Academy begins, it will chronicle my journey there.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p>I&#8217;d like to recommend RubyMonk as a great starting point for learning Ruby. &nbsp;It is a great introduction to the language. &nbsp; In my opinion, it&#8217;s much more effective than codecademy. &nbsp;Moreover, the problems they have are top notch and force you to think.&nbsp;</p>


<p><span>Log for 4/10 - 4/21</span></p>


<ul>
<li>PeepCode - Episode 83, Play by Play with Ben Orenstein</li>
<li>RubyMonk Primer (Complete except a handful of problems)</li>
<li>Thoughtbot&#8217;s Intermediate Ruby on Rails course - Part 3</li>
<li>Agile Development with Heroku webinar</li>
</ul>
