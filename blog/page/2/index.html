		<p>The Ruby Rogues episode on <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/105-rr-regular-expressions-with-nell-shamrell/">regular expressions</a> is pretty awesome. Regular expressions are a way to express patterns in a programming language.  Regular expressions are powerful, but can be very intimidating. <a href="http://rubular.com">Rubular</a> is a nice tool to play around with them, and the chapter on regular expressions in <em>The Well Grounded Rubyist</em> provides a great explanation.</p>

<p>I passed the CA bar exam! That being said, landing a job as a web developer is still my number one goal.  Being a lawyer will be just another skill that I bring to the table.  This means that I&rsquo;ll need to find resources to learn about laws and regulations that affect start-ups. Being a web developer that can also handle routine and simple legal issues will help me stand out.  Web Developer / Counsel would be a nice job title.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lawline.com/">Lawline</a> might be a good resource to learn more. I tried a course on them about negotating SaaS deals which was pretty informative. A general theme of the video was to be explicit about every provision, including confidentiality and ownership. The instructor also stated that the majority of contracts created by tech vendors are pretty horrible because companies tend to reuse old contract and they aren&rsquo;t clear on the intent of the agreement.</p>

<p>Heads up, Code School will be <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/free-weekend?fb_action_ids=10201128707883052&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_ref=.UZaSvvvXBpk.send&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582">free</a> May 25th to May 26th. Code School is a fantastic <em>starting off point</em> for many topics.  Their courses are always well made and designed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>One of the great things about the ruby (and software community in general) is that there are a lot of resources available to learn from.</p>

<p><a href="http://destroyallsoftware.com">Destroy All Software</a> has just made the screencasts available for purchase by season. They weren&rsquo;t available for the past few months while Gary Bernhardt switched pricing models.  I&rsquo;m working through the first season right now and am learning a lot.  It&rsquo;s almost worth it alone to see how fast and efficient he is with vim.</p>

<p>Vim tip: Relative numbers is a <a href="http://forum.thoughtbot.com/t/give-set-relativenumber-a-try/22">winner</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='line'><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">relativenumber</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I like using the <a href="https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle">numbertoggle</a> plugin. It automatically switches to absolute numbers when I switch to insert mode, and it switches back to relative numbers when I leave.</p>

		<p>Well, the switch to Octopress seems pretty complete.  Here are just a few of my thoughts on it.</p>

<p>Give octopress a try. It&rsquo;s easy to set up.  It&rsquo;s easy to post content.</p>

<ul>
<li>Octopress makes it incredibly easy to write and publish from the command line.</li>
<li>Everything about an octopress blog will be stored locally.</li>
<li>This gives freedom to switch publishing platforms or web hosts and a local backup of posts(with version control!).</li>
<li>Octopress is made for coders.  Inserting code snippets is incredibly easy.  There are also a large number of plugins to extend functionality.</li>
</ul>


<p>I will miss some aspects of tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tumblr is an incredible way to make connections and really is social blogging at its best.</li>
<li>Tumblr has apps to make mobile publishing simple.</li>

		<p>I will slowly be making a move from tumblr to octopress.</p>

<p>Octopress is a framework built on Jekyll, a static blog generator.</p>

<p>I think as I get more familiar with it, the switch to octopress will allow me a greater ability to customize the site.
Moreover, octopress (and jekyll) allow me a greater freedom in how I write my posts.</p>

<p>I have been trying for the past few hours on ways of importing my older posts from tumblr.  I&rsquo;ve tried a variety of methods, including <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/">jekyll-import</a>
but have run into issues.  I&rsquo;ll keep playing around with it though!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><strong>Intro to tmux</strong></p>


<p>tmux is a terminal multiplexer. &nbsp;At it&#8217;s most basic, it allows you create windows and panes inside a tmux session. &nbsp;Each window and pane is a separate instance of a terminal. &nbsp;</p>


<p>I&#8217;ll try to explain why tmux works <em>for me</em>, and I&#8217;ll finish with links on how to set it up. &nbsp;</p>


<p>This is not aimed to be a guide on setting up tmux, or how to use tmux. &nbsp;It is just an explanation of why it has become essential<em> to me</em>, and why it is worth a try. &nbsp;There are alternatives; iterm2 has it&#8217;s own way of handling panes; there is also screen. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t tried either, and I&#8217;m not implying that tmux is better than either. &nbsp;</p>


<p><span>Also, I am still a novice; I have a tremendous amount to learn about improving my workflow.</span></p>


<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6565481/tmux.png"><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/7ca4b1bdf4c5fb7d5ab1d5dfe10cad9a/tumblr_inline_mmt29dEyHR1qz4rgp.png" /></a></p>


<p><strong>Panes, Panes, Panes.</strong></p>


<p>Since I began to code through test-driven-development, I almost always code so that I can see both my test file and the code that it is testing. &nbsp;In sublime, this involved using a two column layout. &nbsp;In vim, I accomplished this through split panes. &nbsp;It is important to see the tests and the code at the same time. &nbsp;</p>


<p>tmux lets me keep a command prompt as a pane in the lower 20% of the screen. &nbsp;This is useful in so many ways. &nbsp;I use it most often for running tests. &nbsp;Using the vim add-on <a href="https://github.com/epeli/slimux">slimux</a>, I can easily send commands to any pane or window I want. &nbsp;Telling that pane to run a test generally requires no more than two keystrokes.</p>


<p>An amazing plugin for Sublime that lets you test is RubyTest. &nbsp;<span>However, tmux allows me to do much more than test. &nbsp;It gives me a full terminal to use that I can expand anytime I want. &nbsp;For example, if I edited a User model to include some database migrations, I would need to run rake db:migrate and rake db:test:prepare before running my actual tests. &nbsp;In Sublime, this requires switching to the terminal app and running those commands, and switching back. &nbsp; In vim, I could accomplish this with :! rake&#8230;.but the resulting output would take up the screen until I pressed enter.</span></p>


<p><span>With tmux, I can do both of these from my text editor without losing focus of my text editor. &nbsp;I am able to see the results of the test and keep typing code.</span></p>


<p>The main advantage of tmux is that I don&#8217;t have to leave tmux for routine editing. &nbsp;Of course, my workflow would be different if I was doing front-end work (designing the site, making sure javascript worked, etc).&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>


<p>Windows are pretty much just tabs. &nbsp;To my knowledge, tmux doesn&#8217;t really add anything crazy to it, but they are there.&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Persistence</strong></p>


<p>tmux has sessions, and it stores persistence. &nbsp;Unless I restart my computer(which does end the session), when I open tmux again, my session will still remain there. &nbsp;Tmux doesn&#8217;t <em>save&nbsp;</em>my session. &nbsp;It keeps running it and by opening tmux again, I am just re-connecting to it.&nbsp;</p>


<p>There are at least two major advantages of this. &nbsp;First, I can quit terminal and come back to my work later without any hesitation. &nbsp;Second, when I return, apps that were running will still be running. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t need to restart my rails server. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t need to open up my rails console again. &nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Sessions</strong></p>


<p>You can have as many sessions as you want. &nbsp;For me, this means having different projects as different sessions. &nbsp;This allows me to switch between them (or work on both of them) at once really easily. &nbsp;Persistence, as mentioned above, becomes incredibly more useful when dealing with multiple projects.</p>


<p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>


<p>Copy and paste from the Mac clipboard does require an additional program (reattach-to-user-namespace) and work, but it is manageable and worth it.&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Plugins worth mentioning</strong></p>


<p><a href="https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator">Tmuxinator</a> allows you to set defaults and save those projects. &nbsp; Slimux lets you send commands to specific panes. &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/vim-turbux">Vim-turbux</a> allows you to send testing commands to panes.</p>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>


<p>Sorry if any of it came off as confusing; I definitely recommend going through a few of the resources below to get a better understanding of tmux&#8217;s power.</p>


<p>I do love working in tmux, but like vim, there is a slight learning curve before becoming really effective with it. &nbsp;Like vim, the preset defaults aren&#8217;t terrific.</p>


<p>The above reasons are why tmux works well for me. &nbsp;There are a lot of reasons to switch that I haven&#8217;t covered, like working on an <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/six-weeks-working-android/">android tablet</a> efficiently or using it to <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/how-we-use-tmux-for-remote-pair-programming/">pair program</a>. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Obligatory first pull request post! For those that don&#8217;t know, a pull request is a way of contributing back to the open source community. &nbsp;You request that the creator/maintainer&nbsp;of a particular piece of software incorporate your code into the overall code to add a feature or fix a bug. &nbsp;</p>


<p>My first pull request was to <a href="https://github.com/lra/mackup">mackup</a>, a program that lets you keep all your dotfiles (specific configuration files for a variety of apps) in sync through Dropbox. &nbsp;This is an entirely easy thing to do without this software through creating symbolic links, but mackup automates this process, cutting down a lot of time and commands. &nbsp;My contribution was adding support for tmuxinator and teamocil dotfiles. &nbsp;It was only about five lines of additional code, but it still feels good to add features onto a piece of software I use regularly. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p>Once again, I&#8217;ll recommend Thoughtbot&#8217;s Learn Prime. &nbsp;I&#8217;m currently doing their Test Driven Rails course, and it has been pretty informative so far. &nbsp;It&#8217;s also pretty nice to learn about testing from one of the contributors to FactoryGirl. &nbsp;With learn prime, you get posting privileges to the new <a href="http://forum.thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot forums</a>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s pretty nice having a a lifeline to the thoughtbot team(including the chat pytel, the ceo, and ben orenstein) on any topic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby">Test First Ruby</a> is a pretty interesting way to practice programming.  It&#8217;s a lot like RubyKoans in the sense that it relies on TDD.  There are many chapters with different objects.  For example, one chapter has you create a pig-latin converter.  Another tasks you to create a Reverse Polish Notion calculator.   Some are a lot simpler, like extending the Array class to add a function (of course, whether doing so is a smart idea is another thing). </p>

<p>In vimadventures, they have these levels where you have to accomplish certain editing and navigating texts within a certain number of keystrokes. The goal is to make you think about it now, so that it can be engrained later.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m still up in the air about making it my primary editor, but it has changed the way I approach Sublime Text.  I&#8217;m constantly asking, is there a way I can do <em>x </em>without reaching for the mouse and without pressing too many keys.   To rephrase an earlier statement, the tools a person chooses are important, but it&#8217;s more important to be efficient and precise with them than choosing the perfect one. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/manual">manual</a> by hacker school is pretty awesome.  The parts on social rules and pair programming are worth a gander.</p>
<p>Toying around with moving the &#8220;Curriculum&#8221; session <a href="https://trello.com/b/NApK9yRl">to a Trello board</a>.  It&#8217;s easier to maintain, allows any trello user to comment, and will help me get used to trello.</p>
<p>Log for 4/30 - 5/1</p>
<ul><li>Started Test-First-Ruby</li>
<li><a href="https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/">Tuts+ tutorial</a> on setting up a good ST2 workflow</li>
<li>Spent a lot of time trying to get an efficient workflow&#8230;went back and forth between vim and ST2 a lot.  I&#8217;m working on posting <a href="https://trello.com/board/my-setup/5181b0017dca609775002b0d">my current setup </a>with both on trello.  </li>

		<p><p><span>I finished Thoughtbot&#8217;s Intermediate Ruby on Rails Workshop.  I, without a doubt, learned a lot from it.  I</span><span>t works out to being $100 with a Learn Prime subscription.   For that price, you get the material (approximately four hours of video), and constant access to the instructor and office hours every week.  I&#8217;d recommend this workshop for this access more than the content (which was quite good too).   I&#8217;m going to be their taking online Test Driven Rails Workshop in May. </span></p>
<p>The Well Grounded Rubyist is an amazing book.  I have a much better understanding of Ruby after reading it.   The first half of the book really prepares you for the second, and it goes from good to amazing in Chapter 10: Enumerables.   It is a long book, but I highly recommend taking a look as it greatly enhanced my comprehension (and love) of Ruby.  </p>
<ul><li><span>Learning more about regular expressions and MatchData has definitely made them less scary(and kind of exciting!).  </span></li>
<li><span>Learning more about the enumerable module gives me a better picture of when to use each method.   Also, knowing that anything can be made to be enumerable-like by adding one method (and an include) is exciting. </span></li>
</ul><p><span>I&#8217;m playing around with zsh (and oh-my-zsh), and I really like it so far.  Tons of great functionality right from installing it.</span></p>
<p>I also started playing around with vim; I&#8217;m not as sure about that, but it&#8217;s getting more appealing the more I learn.  I figure, even if I don&#8217;t end up using it as my full-time text editor (ST2 is so shiny), it&#8217;s still good to have a grasp of it.  Although as I&#8217;m writing this, <a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/">xkcd&#8217;s newest comic</a> asks how long can you work on making a routine task more efficient before you&#8217;re spending more time than you save.</p>
<p>Project Euler gives language agnostic coding challenges requiring you to create code to help you set up a math problem.  For example, find all the sum of the even Fibonacci numbers up to four million.  They&#8217;re great exercises to work through to help improve basic programming.  </p>
